# Zombie Game
Top-down waved based zombie shooter


## Set-up


**Download Python** 

https://www.python.org/downloads/


**Install PyGame**

https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted

PyGame works with most versions of python. A good choice for a Python version to use would be 3.10.9

To install it, run command 

>python -m pip install pygame

If using python 3.11 or newer some people were having issues installing PyGame, so you need to use the --pre flag to get the prerelease PyGame version.

For these python versions use this command 

>python -m pip install pygame  --pre
