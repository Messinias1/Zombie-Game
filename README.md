# Zombie Game
Top-down waved based zombie shooter


## Set-up


**Download Python** 

https://www.python.org/downloads/

Our project works with Python versions 3.8 and newer.


**Install PyGame**

https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted


To install it, run command 

>python -m pip install pygame

If using python 3.11 or newer some people were having issues installing PyGame, so you need to use the --pre flag to get the prerelease PyGame version.

For these python versions use this command 

>python -m pip install pygame  --pre

****

## Running the game

You can run the game through command line

First, clone this repository and 'cd' into the folder where you cloned it, then run these commands:

> cd f22m-main

> python main.py

# Team M: Our Process

Throughout this project's development we've set teamwork and communication as our main goal. Here we'll mention the things that worked best for us.

**GitHub**

In GitHub, each group member created their own branch where they would develop the code for their chosen class. We would also create new branches when needed.

We utilized Issues and the GitHub Project features to help plan features and keep track of everything in our game. 

At the start of our project, we came up with the idea that someone should initially make a "groundwork" for our game that included a basic map with the player able to move around it, so that everyone in the group would be able to base their code around the same thing. 

After we had brainstormed a few main ideas of how we wanted our game to look and feel, we collaboratively implemented a basic map, a scrolling mechanic, and a moveable player sprite.

Through this idea, even though each team member chose a class idea that was completely different from each other's, we could all know whether or not our code was working by simply testing it against the code in the main branch.

Having a pull requests system where other group members needed to approve changes in code was very beneficial for us as it allowed everyone to stay on track and let team member tell others what was working and what wasn't in their code before merging.

**Microsoft Teams**

We kept all non-code documents for our project on our Teams page (SRS pages, Design Document, etc).

**Discord**

Because we weren't all familiar with Teams, we also coordinated through Discord
