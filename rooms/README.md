In my code rooms are created by using a json file formatted like:

["WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW",

"WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW",

... ]

where each "W" will become a wall, and each list item is its own row of walls.

We can add more characters than "W" for different types of walls, or different ground types.


I don't know if this is the best approach for when we need to program the zombie AI but we can change it later if needed
